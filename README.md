# Seventy-Three

Seventy Three is a dashboard of tools for family and friends of individuals under a 72 hour hold, following a suicide attempt. It enables supporters to assemble a support team, facilitate Q&A with professionals, share check-ins, learn about treatments, insurance coverage, success stories, and more.

Built on the MEAN stack, I paid particular attention to creating a component based, custom directive structure that is easily expandable, adaptable and ready for Angular 2.0. I was excited to use Twilioâ€™s messaging API for communication as well as Angular Material and D3.js for the visuals.
